# Pokemon-Eclipse-Game

This was the first Programming project I did for my intro computer science class at my Junior College.
We were able to create our own project to display what we had learned throughout the class and I chose to make a turn based Pokemon battel clone where you are put against computer controlled teams that increase in strength and difficulty as you play eventually leading to a main boss. Each round of combat you can choose to either attack, change pokemon, or give up. For attacks you have 3-4 attacks to choose from, some of them having the type advantage relating to the Pokemon which either is "Super effective" against the weaker type (ie Water vs Fire), "Less effective" against resisant type (ie Water vs Grass), or normal otherwise. For changing Pokemon you start with Squirtle, Pikachu, and Bulbasaur which evolve and learn new moves after winning a certain amount of battles.

The objective of this class was to gain a strong understanding of the fundamentals of programming including basic sorting and searchign algorithms along with simple data structures. This project displays my understanding of object oriented programming and multiple file code. This program has a strong emphasis on function calls and definitely has a lot to improve on. If I were to return to this project one change I would make is to create an abstract "Pokemon" type a "Move list" file which would be used to created each individual pokemon in order to drastically minimize the amount of class and header files the program has.
